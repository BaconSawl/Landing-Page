# Landing-Page
This is for the "landing page" project on TheOdinProject!
Inspired by [Criosyom's Hakurei_Shrine](https://github.com/Criosyom/Hakurei_Shrine) and many others' landing pages.
I really had to use alot of tutorials and references from others' landing page creations, but it was a really fun experience!
Even though I'm suck at choosing the right colors to fit her theme. So feedbacks and critisms are welcomed!

# Haru Urara
The webpage is mostly introduction to every Umamusume: Pretty Derby 's beloved uma daughter Haru Urara, who sadly passed away on 9/9.
I never got to finish it before her death, so I tried my best to complete it now.
One last gift for the departed.
